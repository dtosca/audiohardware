<p>The DIY Ttamatone has become it's own entity - the Otamatrone 4093.</p>

<h2>Design Changes</h2>

<p>The biggest design change is the aesthics and enclosure - I couldn't find a rubber ball that suited this project, so I pivoted to making a square cardboard enclosure for the body.</p>

<p>I removed the button that would make the otamatone "talk," after breadboarding it and seeing that the soft pot itself completed the circuit and it wasn't making noises continuously.</p>

<p>I also added a switch to turn the whole machine on and off.</p>

<h2>Lasercutting and soldering</h2>

<p>I used the Epilog Mini lasercutter to make the body and handle. I made the handle by gluing two cardboard pieces together and sticking the soft pot between them. The AI files can be found here.</p>

<p>I soldered the pieces together. It all went perfectly according to plan, as it always does (/sarcasm).</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, the switch doesn't <i>actually</i> work - I suspect it's because of faulty soldering, but it could also be a wiring issue.</p>
