<p>Hardware - it's a mysterious thing. Sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't work.</p>

<p>This week, I tried to recreate the oscillator we made in class.</p>

<p>To make sure I understood things, I followed along the Handmade Electronic Music and made sure I read everything thoroughly.</p>

<p>I went to insert my chip, and BAM! It bent!</p>

<p>I decided to try to unbend it and I marched onward. Unfortunately, no sound came out.</p>

<p>I tried adjusting from a 100Ω resistor to a 10Ω resistor. No luck. I unplugged it all and replugged it. Nothing!</p>

<p>I will continue to pray to the oscillator gods until my circuit works.</p>
