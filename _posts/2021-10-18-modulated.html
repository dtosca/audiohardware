<p>Hello and welcome to another episode of "why doesn't my shit work?!"</p>

<p>Today, we have the Modulated Frequency circuit, found on page 146 of <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Handmade-Electronic-Music-The-Art-of-Hardware-Hacking/Collins/p/book/9780367210106?gclid=Cj0KCQjwtrSLBhCLARIsACh6RmgWwcSNL4yq6E2mBS8H6rcJr8HLqEXv7uYpespV1wryWOZlbIDg3VMaAn_TEALw_wcB">Handmade Electronic Music, 3rd edition</a></p>

<p>It's beautiful, and it has clear instructions!</p>

<h2>Where did I go wrong</h2>

<p>I had to go out and buy the right capacitors (thank you to today's sponsors The Micro Center), but I didn't pick up the right potentiometers.</p>

<p>The recipe calls for three 100 kOhm pots. I substituted two 10 kOhm pots and a 1M Ohm, hoping it would taste the same.</p>

<p>But, alas, nothing happened!</p>

<p>It may have also been the speaker that didn't work - maybe it needs more power than a 3V coin cell battery can give.</p>

<p>I'm going to find the right pots and see if the circuit works.</p>

<p>Will I ever get a ciruit to work at home? Stay tuned...</p>
