subtitle: Welcome to my blog.

As a young artist who has made the mistake of never documentaing anything, I was glad that all my professors decided to mandate having process blogs for class. 

Except, of course, I had to go and overcomplicate things.

![screenshot of a tweet that reads "my professors: make a blog. It's simple, shouldn't take too long. Me: I will spend three days learning two new blog frameworks that don't work."](assets/images/tweet "Angry tweet").

I didn't want to make a Wordpress blog, because I don't know anything about Wordpress. I didn't want to use Medium, because I think it's ugly and too messy to manage three different blogs.

So I opted to go for a Jekyll blog hosted on GitHub pages. After all, [I've done it before](https://undenailable.github.io/), so it would be simple. Except, in the world of programming, nothing is ever straightforward!

I spent three days debugging, ended up learning a different blog framework, and here I am.

I hope this doesn't foreshadow how the entire class will go. :)

Conclusion: yay, it works!
