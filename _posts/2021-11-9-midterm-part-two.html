<p>As usual, everything went perfectly well and I never had a single problem. /s</p>

<p>Just kidding, soldering hurts!</p>

<h2>Updated Diagrams</h2>

<p>I updated the diagrams to include a FSR and a switch:</p>

<h2>Breadboard</h2>

<p>I put everything on the breadboard and (after fixing the switch), it made sound! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰</p>

<h2>Soldering</h2>

<p>The electronics could tell I was getting confident, so they fixed that by not working when I soldered the components.</p>

<h2>Mistakes and next steps</h2>

<p>After crying and reflecting, I thought about the mistakes I made:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I didn't test each connection as I was going, so now I can't tell where I made the mistake.</li>
  <li>I didn't actually have the right chip - but the chip is still usable because pins 1 and 2 are similar to the correct chip.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll try again to get this working this week. Thankfully, I bought two of everything!</p>
